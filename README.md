Welcome to the repository of the Adaptive Genomics and Genetics lab at the Centro de Biotecnología y Genómica de Plantas (CBGP) in Madrid, Spain.

We use bioinformatics, molecular biology and genetics in Arabidopsis and tomato to identify and characterise genes important for plant adaptation and domestication.
